Description: Implementations of several multiple testing procedures that control
    the family-wise error rate (FWER) designed specifically for discrete tests.
    Included are discrete adaptations of the Bonferroni, Holm, Hochberg and
    Šidák procedures as described in the papers Döhler (2010) "Validation of
    credit default probabilities using multiple-testing procedures"
    <doi:10.21314/JRMV.2010.062> and Zhu & Guo (2019) "Family-Wise Error Rate
    Controlling Procedures for Discrete Data" 
    <doi:10.1080/19466315.2019.1654912>. The main procedures of this package
    take as input the results of a test procedure from package 'DiscreteTests'
    or a set of observed p-values and their discrete support under their nulls.
    A shortcut function to apply discrete procedures directly to data is also
    provided.
